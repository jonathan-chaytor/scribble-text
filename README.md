# Scribble Text
Library to select text and turn it into wavy lines to create less distracting mockups

## Quick Start
1. This project requires JQuery as a dependency 
2. Clone or download the respository and include main.js and styles.css in your website.
3. Initialise Scribble Text in your HTML by calling the scibble.replace() function passing a JQuery selector (string) as an argument. This selector will define which elements are replaced with scribbles. 
```html
<script>scribble.replace('h2,p');</script>
```
